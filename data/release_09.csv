remarks: Three points to mention for this release: <br />
    * The data for weeks 4-5 and 6-7 was provided as one data point. The
    numbers have therefore been averaged to allow correct weekly display.
    * The statistics shown here may not agree fully with the newer methods
    used on the Statistics page. The difference is only a few percent in
    most cases. This page has purposely not been updated against the new
    methodology, but the newer statistics are available upon request.<br />
    * The August 2008 intrusion event caused an unavoidable statistics lag.
    Since connections and statistical counting were hampered for roughly
    three weeks, we choosed no to provide the data in this visualisation. It
    is, however, still available at 
    <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legacy_statistics#Fedora_9_.28Sulphur.29">
