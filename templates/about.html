<h1>About these statistics</h1>

<b>Currently, there is no reliable way to determine the total number of Linux
users, or even count the total number of users of any Linux distribution
which does not have a mandatory per user registration process.</b>
<br />
Anyone who tells you otherwise may be misinformed, dishonest, or trying to sell you something.

<p>
  The numbers above do not represent a total user count for Fedora.  We
  are counting IP addresses because that is the only thing we can
  reliably measure. 
  <i>OEM shipping numbers, application popularity contests, and other
  "estimates" all have intrinsic error factors as well.</i> 
  Without a 1:1 sales figure or registration process, user counting is a
  difficult problem to solve.  
  Our <a href="#Accuracy_of_metrics">accuracy</a> section below has a
  discussion of what's wrong with IP number counts, too.
</p>

<p>When you hear someone estimate a count of users, the right questions to ask are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Precisely how did you arrive at this number? </dt>
    <dd> For Fedora the answers are located at
      <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Statistics/Commands"
        title="Statistics/Commands">this page</a>.
    </dd>
  <dt> Where is the data located, so someone can duplicate the process? </dt>
    <dd> Although you do need appropriate access to our logging hosts to
      gather the data, our <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure"
      title="Infrastructure">
        Infrastructure</a>
      team does welcome people who want to participate in their work.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3> Accuracy of metrics </h3>
<p>The numbers above, for yum, represent unique IP addresses that reach
our update server, not simply downloads. We believe it is reasonable to
equate a "new IP address checking in" with "a new installation of Fedora",
with the following caveats:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Users who have dynamic IP addresses will likely be counted multiple
    times, which inflates the number by some amount.
  </li>
  <li> Users who are behind NAT or corporate proxies will not be counted at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The anecdotal evidence that we receive from different groups, companies,
  and organizations suggests that group (2) is significantly larger than
  group (1).  As such, we believe that the true numbers in the field are
  higher than the numbers on this page.
</p>

  measurement of Fedora's userbase, refer to <a class="external text"

<h3> Why is the Fedora 8 count so high? </h3>
<p>
  We believe this is due to the high concentration of Fedora 8 images on
  Amazon EC2.  We may see additional changes with Fedora 14 and later as
  that release is expected to be <a 
  href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_14_on_EC2#Interview_with_Justin_Forbes"
  title="Fedora 14 on EC2">available on EC2</a> on release day.

<h2> Smolt Data </h2>
<p>
  <a class="external text" href="http://smolt.fedoraproject.org">Smolt</a> 
  is Fedora's hardware profiling project.  It is an <b>opt-in</b> database
  that tracks unique installations of Fedora, and various details about
  that install.  People who install to runlevel 5 will be able to opt-in
  during firstboot, but people who install to runlevel 3 will have to
  install the smolt client via yum and manually register.
</p>

<h2> BitTorrent </h2>
<p>
  The following table shows the number of downloads that have been made
  over BitTorrent. This table shows downloads only through trackers connected
  to the <a class="external text" href="http://torrent.fedoraproject.org">
    official torrent server</a>.
